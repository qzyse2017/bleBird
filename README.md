![logo](logo/bleBird-medium.png)

## Motivation
Having been led by various social network and seen something more and more limited in single views? While this project is built to change the condition.  
This project aims at letting you see more various opinions, both voted up and down by othes, and want to provide the users more control over what they want to see and what they can see.  

## Main features different from social apps  nowadays
- [ ] Do not provide the functionality to follow others (Yes! It is a feature, not bug! Prevent you from following other users so you will not be led by others' activity here)
- [ ] Algorithms which you can choose to filter the messages you will get and any single algorithm here will prevent you from getting messages in a specific order which generated from others' activities(like voting up and down).
- [ ] Ramdon returned results for your search, your reading will be rather random here ```:)```
- [ ] A subsystem aims at competing against advertisement and other information which is illegal.
- [ ] A subsystem aims at letting the searching results get more close to what the user want to get. 

## Why the project name?
There is a legend in Chinese classic culture about a blue bird which sent messages for a celestial, Hsi Wangmu in Penglai Mountain. This project aims at fetching you messages and preventing interference from others so I name it BleBird which stands for blue bird.

## Welcome for issues, bugs reports and PRs
To let this project more close to its goals, any issues, bug reports and PRs will be appreciated a lot, especially those about preventing the returned results from guiding by any users' malicious actions such as posting the same posts in large amounts.
