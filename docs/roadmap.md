- [ ] design search apis for the user to better search(`:(`, seems hard...)
- [ ] let the database be pluggable, you can choose a proper database yourself, design some api for the top level to call, each database, if needed to be used, should implement these interfaces first(though I do not think I can do this work well now `:(`).
